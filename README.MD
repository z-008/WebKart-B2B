WebKART

Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) refers to a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another. This typically occurs when:

A business is sourcing materials for their production process (e.g. a food manufacturer purchasing salt).
A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g. a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances).

In Webkart we sell items in bulk in b/w two people who need the service and who need to provide service
